# Connect 4

## Getting Started

Hey there, Welcome to the Connect 4 game made as a project for AWD module. In this repository you will find all the necessary files to run the application.
The game Connect4 was developed by a group of students at Darmstadt University of Applied Sciences as part of the block course 'Advanced Web Development' in SS 2021.
Project Developers:
- Nikita Fabian Bogutzk
- Joseph Acosta-Becker
- Felix Clemens Karl Christians
- Lavinia Mihut
- Haythem Trabelsi 

## Tech/framework used
- React
- Express
- Node
- MySQL
- REST

## Motivation
Our Motivation in this project was to overcome the classic rule of Connect 4 of having set rules. Therefore we decided to implement this game with the advantages that in our game  you can adjust the size of the playing field as you like, so that the joy of playing can never be lost.

### Requirements
This application is based on docker, therefore you need to install docker locally. Take a look under this link on how to do that. https://docs.docker.com/get-started/

you can start the whole project with `docker-compose up -d` and you will find the project under `http://localhost:3000`

### Installation with Docker

- Go to the `frontend`-folder and install all the requirements with

```bash
npm install
```

- Go to the `backend`-folder and install all the requirements with

```bash
npm install
```

- Go to the initial folder and start the Frontend/Backend/Database with

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Updating the schema of the database

```bash
docker-compose exec backend bash
npm run typeorm schema:drop # Deletes the current schema
npm run typeorm schema:sync # Creates a schema based on your data
```

### Now you can start the application.
